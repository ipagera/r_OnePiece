        "body": "Chapter 956 depicts a One Piece world practically at the verge of its version of a World War. <br><br>As Law predicted, the departure of Doflamingo, the Joker, the Main Broker tying all the strings of the Underworld and the Three Great Powers, has created a crippling event for all parties.<br><br>1) Kaido has lost his supply of devil fruit soldiers, and, seeking an alternative source of brutal military force, he has teamed up with long-aquaitance Big Mom, who he has known since a time where they were both part of Pre-Roger Era's unrivaled Pirate Crew \u2014 The Rox. Yonkos are no longer power balanced.<br><br>2) Shichibukais have been abolished. Coby, now promoted to the Rank of Rear-Admiral, together with Drake, the Supernova, are introduced as a member of \"Sword\", a secret force that coordinates undercover intelligence gathering with on behalf of the Marines (Rosinante and Sengoku were probably at least involved with it, at the time Drake infiltrated the Barrel Pirates, who had found the Ope Ope no Mi). Coby is now deployed to capture Boa Hancock. He joins a full world-scale deployment of Marine personnel that is hunting the Warlords. Marineford only briefly overviewed the physical scale of Warlords, this is now explored further \u2014 Coby says they have no more forces to deal with anything else. Marines vs. Shichibukai is the first really opening battlefront. This conflict will weaken them towards Kaido & Big Mom's might.<br><br>2a) Sabo, who is likely still alive, and by extension, has probably been framed for a crime against the Nefertari Family \u2014 probably Vivi. <br><br>At the same time King Cobra, requesting an audience to the Gorosei, has been likely asking questions about the Void Century, Pluton and the role of The Poneglyphs \u2014 The 5 Elders have clearly showed their intention to silence him.<br><br>Im-sama, the true Highest Authority of the One Piece World, has likely indicated Vivi as the next light to extinguish. She's young, activist, even if exiled, a tenryuubito, the depositary of the country hiding Pluton and poses the greatest future political threat at the Reveries vs. her weakening father.<br><br>I speculate Sabo found out about this while infiltrating Marijoa, and managed to save her, fighting the Admirals in the process \u2014 the Big News are a cover up. Marines are secretly hunting him. Sabo and Revo Commanders vs. Marines.<br><br>Blackbeard, a true mastermind a D., a men of desires, sees through the event and decides to take advantage of the weakened parties to take \"that\" \u2014 the Mera Mera no Mi he is obsessioned to since Dressrosa. Revolutionaries, protecting Sabo, will exact their retaliation for Baltigo's incident. Revolutionaries vs. Blackbeard, a Yonko, vs. Marines. The second front opens.<br><br>3) The World Government, through the CP-0 handles its largest weapon contractor in Wano Country, and this is none but Kaido.<br><br>Surrounding the Straw Hats is slowly, but steadily, gathering a simply astronomical amount of forces. <br><br>At least 4200 Wano Samurai, and between them The 9 Red Scabbards, whose notable members have been shown to be able to hold their own against Shichibukai level-opponents (Kinemon can cut explosions and his torso could rival with Law's swordmanship in Punk Hazard) and Yonko-Commanders (Ashura has been shown to effortlessly slash Jack).<br><br>The Minks, whose warriors could rival with an entire dispatch of the Beast Pirates, will turn Sulong at their Fire Festival \u2014 their two leaders, Nekomamushi and Inuarashi are Yonko-Commander level. With them, there is a concrete chance Marco The Phoenix and the remnants of the Whitebeard Pirate will also show up.<br><br>Jinbei, a former Shichibukai and someone who could briefly push back a weakened Big Mom, the Sun Pirates, Trafalgar D. Water Law and the Heart Pirates. <br><br>Conqueror's Haki wielder and Luffy's rival \u2014 Captain Kidd, Killer has the remnants of the Kidd Pirates.<br><br>The Straw Hats Grand Fleet, 5600 men strong and with powerful captains.<br><br>Luffy and Zoro, fresh with strong power ups.<br><br>Although I can't still see Big Mom & Kaido's Allience falling, Luffy will undoubtedly strike a massive hit on them.<br><br>The Supernova are all mostly involved here.<br><br>It will eventually be a significant part of the 2nd tier world pirates' entire might vs. the Two Yonkos.<br><br>THE WILDCARDS<br><br>\"ROX\" \u2014 Anticipation towards the old era's mightiest pirate has been slowly been building up. What better moment than the world turning upside down, to surface from the shadows of legend?<br><br>One Piece World is clearly a colorful, yet faithful representation of the world we live in and broad-strokes all its main characteristics \u2014 political corruption, media manipulation, threats to democracy, social, ethnical, ideological and religion issues. Misery. Slavery. <br><br>Wouldn't One Piece be incomplete without a sci-fi twist? Germa 66, Vegapunk, Pacifista Cyborgs with DF-based capabilities, WG'S next superweapon, Artificial DF, Genetic experiments for Gigantification, the long fanbase forgotten Space Pirates, and finally the strong symbolism of the Moon as a celestial object, origin to the Birkan Civilization and full with ancient technological mysteries. hints to this being a genuine component of One Piece are all over the story.<br><br>Aliens. Sure, ALIENS ARE MISSING! What's the wildest speculation?!<br><br>The night of the Fire Festival, a Full Moon Night, Enel, One Piece's representation of Raijin, the God of Thunder will invade the Blue Sea at Wano.<br><br>Doflamingo, witnessing the events, howls from the depths of Impel Down with the foulest of laughters.<br><br>The Throne War has begun."

If the information on their \u201calliance\u201d is true, then the worst pirate crew in the world is about to be borne.<br><br>Brannew!! What are the current bounties of those two?<br><br>Brannew: Oh yes, we are working on the new bounties of those who have been stripped of their Warlord position.<br><br>Let\u2019s review all of their bounties.<br><br>\u2014First, we have \u201cBlackbeard\u201d, whom people started to call an Emperor about a year ago. He obtained strong subordinates during the attack on Impel Down 2 years ago. Right now he\u2019s the \u201cruler\u201d of Pirate Island Beehive. He\u2019s the new power that replaced Whitebeard, and he\u2019s still growing.<br>The admiral of \u201cBlackbeard Pirates\u201d, Marshall \u201cD\u201d Teach!! Bounty: 2.2476 billion berries!!!<br><br>\u2014Next, we have him who\u2019s been call an Emperor for 6 years, the youngest of the four and he\u2019s trusted by his subordinates.<br>Beckman, Roo, and Yasopp...his commanders make a name for themselves one after another. Known for having a high average bounty among the members, the crew with the best balance, a impregnable crew.<br>The leader of \u201cRedHair Pirates\u201d, \u201cRedHair Shanks\u201d!!! Bounty: 4.0489 billion berries!!!<br><br>Next, it is said that she attacked a village of Elbaf when she\u2019s just a child. A natural born monster!! She is a dictator queen who doesn\u2019t believe anything other than bloodline, and created a bizarre country known as \u201cTotto Land\u201d with her 85 children.<br>Captain of \u201cBig Mom Pirates\u201d, Charlotte LinLin!!!<br>Bounty: 4.388 billion berries!!!<br><br>And\u2014even though he was just a \u201cpirate apprentice\u201d at the \u201cRocks Pirates\u201d.........later his personal strength attracts the respect of groups of brutal pirates, to the point of being call an Emperor.<br>The General of \u201cBeasts Pirates\u201d, \u201cKaido of the Beasts\u201d. Bounty: 4.6111 billion berries!!!<br>From now on, we\u2019ll not be able to use the \u201cWarlords\u201d against the \u201cFour Emperors\u201d!! Whether the choice of omitting those poisonous ones is correct or not, is depended on the future work of SSG, the special science corp of Marine.<br><br>\u2014By the way we\u2019ll also review the bounties of those legenardy men.<br>Captain of \u201cWhitebeard Pirates\u201d, Edward Newgate!! Bounty: 5 billion berries!!!<br><br>Captain of \u201cRoger Pirates\u201d, the \u201cPirate King\u201d Gold Roger, bounty: 5.5 billion berries!!!<br><br>From Shuhui:<br><br>- According to news reports, in the God Valley incident 38 years ago, the Rocks Pirates was destroyed by Marine Vice Admiral Garp.<br>Which is why he\u2019s called the \u201cHero of Marine\u201d, though he himself doesn\u2019t like that title.<br>What really happened was: in order to protect the Celestial Dragons and their slaves, Garp and Roger worked together to defeat the Rocks Pirates.One of the reasons Garp refuse to be promoted to admiral is that admirals are direct subordinates of the Celestial Dragons."
