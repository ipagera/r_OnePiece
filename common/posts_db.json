But when the time came to guard our shogun, we failed miserably- and see for yourself where the country has been to.<br><br>&#x200B;<br><br>**Kinemon:** I take full responsibility as the lead--<br><br>&#x200B;<br><br>**Shutenmaru:** Shut up! You are no leader. What makes you think you're the leaders. It's not you who have been working in the shadows and looking after the nation ever since that monster and that good for nothing Orochi came  and plotted such heinous act on this land. You have no right to call yourself a leader. I will never be a part of the nine scabbards. But, I will, for Oden's sake, for Lady Toki's promise, will fight along side you and your little buddies you've brought along.<br><br>&#x200B;<br><br>**Kinemon**: *\\[bows down* \\]Thank you!
