We're only low life criminals to whom Oden gave a ray of hope to live a better life. But when the time came to guard our shogun, we failed miserably- and see for yourself where the country has been to.<br><br>&#x200B;<br><br>**Kinemon:** I take full responsibility as the lead--<br><br>&#x200B;<br><br>**Shutenmaru:** Shut up! You are no leader. What makes you think you're the leaders. It's not you who have been working in the shadows and looking after the nation ever since that monster and that good for nothing Orochi came  and plotted such heinous act on this land. You have no right to call yourself a leader. I will never be a part of the nine scabbards. But, I will, for Oden's sake, for Lady Toki's promise, will fight along side you and your little buddies you've brought along.<br><br>&#x200B;<br><br>**Kinemon**: *\\[bows down* \\]Thank you! It means a lot.<br><br>&#x200B;<br><br>**Shutenmaru:** However, don''t assume everyone else have the same devotion towards this nation as they did 20 years ago. Things have changed. But, if we ever are going to take down that monster and slay that bastard Orochi- there's something we will need. Follow me inside...<br><br>&#x200B;<br><br>**Page 3-4**<br><br>\\[*Kaido has been reported about Big Mom's arrival at Udon. Kaido is briefed about Queen situation.\\]*<br><br>**Kaido:** THAT GOOD FOR NOTHING KING! Inform him immediately and ask him to aid Queen right now. If he does not fixes his mess, I will personally teach these bastards what torture really is.<br><br>**Bed wetting Fodders:** Y-Yes.. K-k-kaido-sama<br><br>**Kaido:** That Old Hag, how dare she talk to me about favors. I asked none from her. That was more than 40 years ago.

While Zoro pulls out few of his move set, Kyoshiro, just calmly deflects them rather easily. Kyoshiro on the other hand does not make much of an \"attacks\" on Zoro despite Zoro's relentless and barrages of air slash at kyoshiro\\]*<br><br>\\*\\*Zoro: \\[\\*\\**stands still and relaxes his swords\\]*  Why are you doing this? And why do I sense hesitation in your attacks? If you think I am some weak swordsmen, then before you make the next move, I will slice you up and behead your master straight away.<br><br>&#x200B;<br><br>\\*\\*Kyoshiro:  \\[\\*\\**Laughs \\]* How scary. I am almost crying here with fear. If you can sense hesitation in my attack then you can also sense how strong I am, don't you? I am not showing you any sympathy or doing you favors. You are waste of my time. I am a samurai- and my skills are beyond your imagination. You're just merely a criminal and a low life pirate, who pretends to wield a sword and disrespects its origin. I bet your master was some scumbag who made you believe, you can be a swordsman..what a joke.<br><br>&#x200B;<br><br>**Zoro:** How dare you speak of my master Koushiro. That's it, I will kill you if I have to in order to take that bastards head..<br><br>&#x200B;<br><br>**Kyoshiro: \\[** *did he just said Koushiro- sweats a bit \\]*<br><br>&#x200B;<br><br>**Page 8-9-10**<br><br>**Law:** How dare you take my crew captive. If any thing happens to them, I will kill you..<br><br>**Hawkins:** You can try if you want to, but you won't be able to put a scratch on me. You actions will affect your crew greatly. So, stop resisting and come along quietly, or there'll be serious consequences.<br><br>**Law:** *\\[Smiles\\]* You expect me to be cowards like you and serve under some emperor. I thought, we're from the same reckless and fearsome worst generation. I guess, facing a Yonkou has made you soft basil hawkins.<br><br>**Hawkins:**  \\*\\*\\*\\[\\*\\*\\**stares at law with anger\\]*<br><br>&#x200B;<br><br>*\\[Scene changes with Drake continuing his attack on Sanji\\]*<br><br>**Drake:** Where do you think you're going. Ever since I heard the news about you being a vinsmoke, I wanted to meet you. However, I never knew, vinsmoke were these clumsy. You really thought you were done with me with such measly attack?<br><br>**Sanji:** STOP CALLING ME A VINSMOKE! I have no blood of that sick bloodline. And who you're calling clumsy, you piece of lizard-shit. *\\[Sanji coats his leg on fire and delivers a powerful blow to Drake's face at full speed\\]*<br><br>&#x200B;<br><br>**Page 10-11-12-13**<br><br>*\\[back at Udon prison, Big Mom continues to beat Queen.

        "body": "So, with the release of the newest Vivre Card Databook (links to u/OharaLibrarianArtur's [post](https://redd.it/ccq0c6) and [databook analysis](https://thelibraryofohara.com/2019/07/13/vivre-card-databook-vol-11-all-the-new-information/)), we've become privy to the information that currently, Jack is only 28 years young, meaning he was only 8 at the time of Kaido's takeover of Wano. Oda, it's honestly ridiculous what you've done here. I mean, since I am reading a manga, especially one as crazy as One Piece, I've had to suspend my disbelief *quite* a bit by this point, but I draw the line when you're telling me a *kid* not even 10 years old was strong enough to help lead a military takeover of a powerful samurai nation. Even for One Piece, this is absolutely ridic--<br><br>Hrm? What's that?<br><br>[Oh.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvfE2pxYQFQ)<br><br>In other news, have you all heard the news about how good the Wano Arc is in the anime currently?

If you're new to Bets and Bravery, B&B is a weekly thread on this subreddit where users bet with fake currency, the Beli from in-universe, on what they think will happen in each week's chapter in a series of bets made by yours truly. I keep track of everyone's money in a giant Google Sheet, which is available in the links above. So, if you're new, enjoy your time! But, if you're a regular on this thread, we're glad to see you back at r/OnePiece's unofficial official pasttime!<br><br>I hope you've all had a good week so far with whatever's been happening in your lives. If you haven't had such a good week so far, I'm wishing the best for you and hope I can brighten your day even a little bit with this post.<br><br>Before we get started, let's refresh your memory of last chapter to get you back on betting track!<br><br>##Last Time on One Piece<br><br>Luffy, still attempting to control his armament haki, is subdued by the Udon prisoners on order of Old Maid to avoid punishment from him and Kaido's forces. Daifugo prepares to execute Luffy with one of Queen's hand-made Plague Bullets until unique laughter emanates from the cell destroyed by Big Mom and Queen's fight. With his cage now open, the guards prepare to execute the prisoner once and for all since his poison execution never offed him. Raizo floats down to the cage and passes the prisoner a sword and the keys to his handcuffs, allowing Kawamatsu the Kappa to break free after 13 years of imprisonment. With a known Scabbard free, the guards are immediately nervous and prepare to execute him and the other prison intruders. Hyougoro speaks to Kiku and Raizo and asks them to reveal their identities in order to show the prisoners that there is still hope for Wano, at which point a fearsome lineup of 3 Scabbards, Hyougoro the Flower, and Luffytaro ~~Hey, what about me!?~~ squad up and prepare to combat the prison guards.<br><br>With that out of the way, let's get into the real meat of the thread...<br><br>#Chapter 948 Betting<br><br>##The Bets of the Week<br><br>###Bet 335<br><br>One of the most important players in the Udon Prison is currently MIA. No, I'm not talking about Queen or Big Mom, Kid or Killer, and definitely not the current lineup of Luffy and Co., I'm talking about \"Wet-Haired\" Caribou. Minor antagonist turned revolutionary, Caribou was captured by X Drake and imprisoned in Udon prior to the Strawhat Crew's arrival on the island. Upon Luffy's imprisonment, Caribou saw a chance to escape with his help and offered his services to the pirate, teaming up with Raizo to stop all communication with Udon from outside and find keys to prisoners' cages and handcuffs. However, since going to cut off outside communication, the super rookie has vanished from the story.<br><br>Despite showing genuine affection for other people such as Gaburu's grandmother during his time as a revolutionary throughout his Cover Story Serial, Caribou has always been a self-preserving kind of person, even abandoning his own brother on occasion as bait for pursuers ~~I mean, who *hasn't* asked their brother to launch a rescue mission for them only to steal his ship and leave him for dead? *Guilty!*~~ So, it isn't too far-fetched to assume that, free from his shackles and with communication cut, Caribou might have already fled from Udon. But doing that is just as risky as staying with the Strawhat Alliance, as he'd be alone in an enemy Yonkou's territory with enemies far stronger than he. Dear audience, where has Caribou gone, has he abandoned Luffy and Co.?<br><br>* A. Caribou has fled the Udon Complex and/or abandoned the Strawhats! Odds 1:2<br><br>* B. Caribou has not abandoned the Strawhats and has just not returned yet! Odds 1:3<br><br>###Bet 336<br><br>20 years of a tyrannical and oppressive reign will do a lot of things to a person's mental psyche and outlook on life, forcing them into submission being just one possibility. With Kaido and Orochi's stranglehold on Wano, prisoners and criminals don't really have much hope for opposing the established leadership in any way, shape or form. However, should there be someone or a group of people the oppressed can rally behind to oppose their abusive rulers, would they not fight for their freedom?<br><br>Well, I don't know how rallying behind a Kappa, a talking reindeer, a trap, a ninja with a head larger than some people, a rubber man, and an old geezer would give any semblance of hope, but it's all the prisoners of Udon have. With such big names as Hyougoro the Flower, the former yakuza head of all of Wano, Kikunojo the Lingering Snow, Kawamatsu the Kappa, and Raizo of the Mist, four powerful allies of the former ruling Kozuki Clan have appeared before the prisoners, just as Lady Toki once prophesied ~~\"Some weird dudes'll come beat up the guy with a sentient free-willed elephant on his chest and break you out of prison,\" -Lady Toki, probably~~ With Queen out of the picture and multiple powerhouses on their side, how will the prisoners react? Dear audience, will the Udon Prisoners be inspired to join the cause for overthrowing Kaido and Orochi?<br><br>* A. All of the prisoners will rally behind the Alliance! Odds 1:2<br><br>* B. Only some of the prisoners will join the cause! Odds 1:3<br><br>* C. The prisoners won't change their minds, Kaido and Orochi are too impossible to overcome! Odds 1:4<br><br>###Bet 337<br><br>> \"Even though Orochi's troops know our names we are saved by the fact that they do not truly believe of our presence. The most important part of this plan is to not be exposed. Our goal is to gather information in complete secrecy and take the commander's [Kaido] head!!\" -Kin'emon, One Piece Chapter 920<br><br>> \"Lol\" -Raizo, Kiku, Kawamatsu, One Piece Chapter 948<br><br>Despite making such a big deal about how important it is to keep hidden and not expose their identities to Kaido and Orochi's forces, literally no one is heeding Kin'emon's advice. Luffy fought Kaido directly, Zoro became a wanted criminal and then he and Sanji exposed themselves saving Toko, Law has been spotted by Hawkins, X Drake recognized Nami and Robin in the bathhouse, and now 3 of Oden's Scabbards are saying \"fuck that\" and exposing themselves to multiple headliners of the Beasts Pirates.<br><br>While in the short term it *could* sway the Udon Prisoners to their cause, with up to thousands of new allies joining the Alliance, in the long term it could be more of a hindrance. Unless every single prison guard is either cut down or imprisoned, any one of them could leak the return of the Scabbards to Orochi's forces. On top of that, with many thousands of possible new allies, how many of them would both stay out of trouble and not spill any beans? Even more so, as soon as Orochi and Kaido know exactly what they're up against, the secret plot to raid Onigashima is out the window as they'd probably just hunt down the Alliance beforehand. This is one plot point I'm excited to see the resolution of, so let's get speculating. Dear audience, will the return of Oden's Scabbards be passed on to Kaido and/or Orochi? <br><br>* A. Yes! Odds 1:2<br><br>* B. No, the Alliance will keep things under wraps in Udon! Odds 1:4<br><br>###Bet 338<br><br>This bet is where you can bet how many pages Chapter 949 will feature!<br><br>**Note:** Shounen Jump covers, fan art pages, or translator note pages from either Jaimini's Box or Mangastream are not counted here. Double page spreads are counted as two separate pages. Color pages and color spreads are counted. Cover story serials and fan-requested cover pages are counted.<br><br>* A. 16 or less pages! Odds 1:10<br><br>* B. 17 pages! Odds 1:1.2<br><br>* C. 18 or more pages! Odds 1:15<br><br>###Bet 339<br><br>Our final bet this week is about the main focus of this week's chapter! The chapter may cover multiple storylines, in which case, the correct answer will be whichever storyline the chapter gave the most attention to in terms of pages or panels, should it get that close!<br><br>* A. Luffy's adventure in the Udon Mines! Odds 1:2<br><br>* B. The chaos in the Flower Capital/Ratetsu Prison District! Odds 1:3<br><br>* C. Other storylines, such as Big Mom's escort, Kaido, Kin'emon and Ashura, or something outside of Wano! Odds 1:5<br><br>##Weekly Mini-game<br><br>With the reveal to the prisoners that Oden's Scabbards are alive and well, I figure this chapter should be centered on those very samurai. Dear audience, I want you to guess in how many panels one of Oden's Nine Red Scabbards appear!<br><br>* **Criteria for WMG:** One of Oden's [Nine Red Scabbards](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Nine_Red_Scabbards) appear in person in a panel.<br><br>* **Note:** We are counting the total number of panels that fit the criteria above. If a Scabbard is mentioned by name in dialogue but does not appear in person, that panel will not count toward the total. Also, while Kyoshiro is heavily theorized to be Denjiro ~~what kind of cursed timeline do we live in where the anime spoils the manga~~, unless we get a reveal for the Ninth Scabbard this chapter, he also will not count toward the total. If a panel features multiple Scabbards, the panel will only count once.<br><br>Guess 100% correctly on this, and you'll receive a whopping 1,500,000 Beli! If nobody guesses correctly, the closest answer receives 750,000 Beli! If multiple people guess correctly or are evenly close to the correct answer, the bounty is evenly split among them to the nearest 1,000 Beli!<br><br>##End of Chapter 949 Betting<br><br>And with that, we've made it through another exciting week of Betting and Bravery!

I've actually instead started work on *another* art project for One Piece in commemoration of the soon-upcoming 300K r/OnePiece subscriber celebration. It's gonna be an epic color spread of the Strawhats, so I hope that'll tide you over until the fan chapter gets here ~~eventually in probably a few months because I'm about to head off to college and that transition's gonna be crazy and I'll have to adjust to a new schedule and have a lot less free time and then I might forget about reddit entirely and then the inevitable B&B \"hiatus\" will arrive and everything goes to shit~~ in a reasonable amount of time.<br><br>Keep an eye out for the post!<br><br>#Thanks for Participating!<br><br>Thanks to everyone out there who dropped by to read this thread, whether all the way through, just skimming, or just dropping by to see what this thread was. I'm truly grateful you all come by and support my work here as much as you do, so thank you. I hope I can keep living up to your expectations as host!<br><br>I wish you all good luck on this week's bets, and I will see you all back later this week after the chapter drops and the results thread is out fo you all to see how you did! Until next time!<br><br>-MADKITTIEZ"
